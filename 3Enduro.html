  <h1>Enduro</h1>
<h3><p>Enduro means riding or racing dirt bikes over challenging long-distance terrain.  Enduro derives its name from “endurance” because the races are typically long and span difficult and varying types of terrain.  Enduro used to refer more to a cross-country dirt bike race, but now is pretty much used any time someone is riding on rough off-road paths.  “Enduro” differs from “Trials” in that the terrain is longer and generally less difficult, but so-called “hard enduro” blurs the lines between enduro and trails dirt biking.</p>
<p>What is considered Enduro riding
 <li>Off-road and not on an official track
<li>Longer distance than what would be done in trials riding or on a track
<li>A normal dirt bike is used and not a trials bike
<li>Usually involves riding on a path or track, but that track is usually not easily passed.  There may be creeks, rocks, mountains to climb, or other obstacles along the way.</P></h3>h3>
