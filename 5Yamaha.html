<p>Yamaha has changed the face of dirt bike history numerous times over the last 40 years. From the first ‘monoshock’ motocrossers of the seventies to leading the four-stroke motocross revolution in 1997, Yamaha dirt bikes have constantly been at the leading edge of innovation.</p> 
<p>Yamaha was founded in 1887 by Torakusu Yamaha as a piano and Reed Organ Manufacturer. The company’s musical instrument heritage is still reflected today with the logo of three interlocking tuning forks. The three tuning forks represent the three pillars of business – technology, production and sales. After World War 2 company president Genichi Kawakami repurposed the production machinery for the manufacture of motorcycles. In 1954 the first production motorcycle, the YA-1 was launched. 125 were built. It was a 125cc single-cylinder two-stroke, patterned on the German DKW RT125. The success of the YA-1 led to the founding of Yamaha Motor Co. Ltd in 1955.</p> <p>1975 was the year Yamaha released the first production model motocross bike with the ‘monoshock’ single rear suspension setup.

In 1976 Yamaha produced another first, the introduction of the air forks with the YZ125X. It was not hugely successful, and by the following year returned to conventional forks.

The late seventies also saw the introduction of the first Japanese two-stroke enduro bikes, the IT series, which led the swing away from the more expensive European competition enduro bikes. The first big-bore four-stroke trail bikes were also appearing with the Yamaha TT and XT500 thumpers. Heavily modified versions were having competition success, like the HL500. A prototype built by Swedish MX world champions Torsten Hallman and Sten Lundin was made famous by Bengt Aberg in the 1977 Swedish 500cc GP series.

His success lead to Yamaha producing a limited run of production HL500s, which boosted sales of the TT/XT500 trail bikes.</p>
<p>In 1996 the AMA changed the rules of Motocross racing to allow a 450cc four-stroke machine to compete in the same class as the 250cc two-stroke. This changed things forever in the MX scene and led to the first victory of a four-stroke bike in an AMA Supercross event in Las Vegas in 1997 by Doug Henry on a Yamaha YZM400F.In 1998 Yamaha released the YZ400F to the public. It was the first mass-produced four-stroke motocross bike.

Yamaha is one of the ‘Big Four’ Japanese manufacturers alongside Suzuki, Honda, and Kawasaki, and has always been an innovator. They have changed the color of their dirt bikes numerous times – yellow/Black, white, Blue.

When you compare today’s enduro and motocross bikes to the first DT1 trail bikes of 1968, the advancement in technology is incredible. The tuning fork company has come a long way.</p>
