<p>GASGAS rose from the mid-1980s succeeding the popular Bultaco and SWM brands.
Our early bikes were predominantly trial models, with a few trail, enduro and entry-level street models offered along the way! GASGAS became a key player on the trial scene from the late 1980s.With 16 FIM trial world titles since 1993 and four consecutive FIM Trial-E titles, the brand’s trial heritage and expertise are unquestioned.GASGAS joined the Pierer Mobility Group. Remaining true to its Spanish roots while benefitting from the group’s proven experience, success and ambitious plans. With our class leading trial bikes continuing to be manufactured in Girona, Spain, from our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Austria we quickly expanded our enduro model line-up and introduced an awesome range of motocross and mini motocross bikes.</p>
    <p>Our global motorsport activities expanded rapidly entering 2020 as we lined up for our first season of MXGP competition. Despite being the new team in the paddock, at only the third round we topped the podium, proving our capabilities to perform in a brand new discipline.As the calendar clicked over to 2021, we entered AMA Supercross and won at our very first attempt! Moving forwards, GASGAS is committed to competing in world championship trial, enduro, rally, supercross and motocross.</p>
