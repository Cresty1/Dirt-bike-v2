    <h3>Honda</h3>

    <p>The history of Honda dirt bikes started with humble beginnings and goes way back to 1948 when the Honda Motor Co. was officially founded. This came about when Soichiro Honda, a mechanic by trade, created the company to provide a solution to Japans war-torn market. They were short on money and fuel (ha! I know the feeling!) but desperately needed a cheap and efficient method of transportation.

The early days of Honda Motor Co. saw them fitting small engines to bicycles, much like Suzuki. The first ‘complete’ motorcycle that Honda produced was the 1949 Dream D-Type – A 98cc road bike that paved the way to a large variety of popular scooters.</p>
<p>By 1959 Mr. Honda had accumulated a list of international motorcycle races that he had personally raced in. Here was a man who not only knew how to create a fine two-wheeled horse, but was also passionate about riding them too!

1959 also saw Honda stretch its wings into the United States. A small shop was opened in Los Angeles – not that anyone wanted to set foot in it. The Americans were more than happy with their Harley’s, Triumph’s and other British bikes and showed no interest in little ol’ Honda bikes. A massive advertising campaign with the slogan ‘You meet the nicest people on a Honda’ changed all that and the early 60’s greeted the American Honda with great success.

People began using the smaller Honda bikes on trails and campgrounds which kick-started dirt bike riding as we know it today. A popular range of Honda dirt bikes began appearing in the late 60’s… and people loved ’em!</p>
<p>In 1972 Honda created a frenzy by releasing a weapon of motocross bike that had everyone diving into their pockets to buy one. The CR250 Elsinore was like no other around. Honda was leading the way…

From there Honda Motor Co. continued to pump out a hugely successful range of Honda
dirt bikes including the XR’s and CR’s, with the CR’s becoming somewhat of a collectors item these days after the CRF’s thundered onto the scene.</p>
