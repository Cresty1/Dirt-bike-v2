<p>Founder Michio Suzuki started off in 1909 in the textile industry producing weaving looms for Japan’s massive cotton industry.

After World War II Suzuki began producing engines that could be fitted to bicycles as a response to the need for affordable transportation in Japan.

In 1952 Suzuki built its first motorized bicycle, the ‘Power Free’. It used a 36cc two-stroke engine fixed to the frame of a conventional bicycle.
By 1954 Suzuki was mass-producing motorcycles, and the Suzuki Motor Company was formed.

Suzuki has remained with its yellow color motocross bikes throughout when most of the other manufacturers have changed several times.

In 1958 the now famous Suzuki ‘S’ logo was first used.</p>
<p>Suzuki’s first entry into the trail bike market came in 1965 with the K15 Hill-Billy. It was an 80cc two-stroke which came with knobby tires, a raised sport-type front fender, spring-loaded folding footpegs, and a skid plate under the engine. It was a big success in the USA.

In 1967 the K15P was introduced. Among its new features was the ‘Posi-Force’ automatic oil lubrication. The K15 model still required you to mix your own oil and gas. Suzuki’s four-stroke series began in 1978 with the SP370. It was Suzuki’s first single-cylinder four-stroke engine. They are very popular with collectors today, heavily modified versions were used in various forms of racing.</p>

<p>The RM ‘Racing Model’ series was introduced in 1975 with the RM125M, and almost overnight the motocross field turned yellow. It was the first of the lay-down twin shock versions which began the long travel suspension revolution.
It was followed on by the RM125A, RM250A, and RM370A in 1976.

The RM series continue to be produced today as four-stroke bikes, with the two-stroke versions being discontinued due to lessening demand for the two-stroke and changes to the racing class structure allowing a 250cc four-stroke to compete in the same class as a 125cc two-stroke.

The RM series was precluded by the TM series which ran from 1971 to 1975.</p>
