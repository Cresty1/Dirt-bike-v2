<p>Kawasaki is one of the ‘Big Four’ powerhouse Japanese motorcycle manufacturers. Motorcycles are just a small part of this 140-year-old company’s ventures. In this look back at Kawasaki Dirt Bike history</p>

<p>They were the first of the ‘Big Four’ Japanese brands to build a purpose-built off-road racing machine and played a pivotal role in bringing the sport of motocross to a new audience.</p>

<p>Never afraid to push the boundaries of technology, regardless of the success of the innovation, Kawasaki has continued to remain at the forefront of competition.</p>

<p>The Early Years
Like all of the other ‘Big Four’ Japanese motorcycle manufacturers, Kawasaki had its beginnings in areas other than motorcycles.
Kawasaki’s origins date back to 1878 when Shōzō Kawasaki established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard in Tokyo.</p>

    <p>Kawasaki Heavy Industries was formed in 1896, whose principal areas of activity were shipbuilding, railroad rolling stock and electrical generating plants.
In 1918 the Aircraft Department was established and Kawasaki succeeded in building Japan’s first metal aircraft.</p>

<p>In 1949 they turned their attention to the motorcycle industry and began making motorcycle engines.It wasn’t until 1956 that the Kawasaki logo was stamped on the engine side covers.</p>

<p>Kawasaki Aircraft initially manufactured motorcycles under the Meguro name, having bought the ailing motorcycle manufacturer with whom they had been in partnership. This eventually became Kawasaki Motor Sales.</p>

    <p>Kawasaki motorcycles from 1961 through to 1967 used an emblem that can be described as a flag within a wing.
In 1961 the first complete Kawasaki motorcycle, the B8 was produced. 
During the late sixties, motocross in America was gaining in popularity. Kawasaki began its US operations in 1966 and by 1968 had dealerships nationwide.
Kawasaki’s high-performance street machines were popular among the road bike crowd, but the off-road sector was still lagging behind.</p>

<p>In 2004, the Kawasaki KX250F made its debut The chassis and bodywork featured Kawasaki’s trademark perimeter frame and KX looks. The motor was a fairly conventional DOHC four-valve fed by a 37mm Keihin FCR carburetor. The KX250F used a road-race style ‘slipper piston’ to produce a high-rpm ceiling.</p>
<p>In 2006 Kawasaki released its open class four-stroke motocrosser. They were the last of the Japanese Big Four to do so, and unlike the 250F, the new 450F was not associated with Suzuki at all, after the two manufacturers ended their alliance in May of that year.</p>

<p>The 450F was set for a 2005 release and was to feature a unique D-style alloy frame, but prototypes being raced in Japan were developing serious frame fractures, which led to the new frame design being scrapped completely.
After a major redesign, Kawasaki went with a more traditional alloy perimeter frame which was a proven sturdy design.</p>

<p>The 2006 KX450F was an instant hit with the motocross buying public. It was a very competitive first effort by Kawasaki, with the only complaint being the four-speed transmission.
The 2007 version received its fifth gear and Kawasaki claimed its first Supercross title in six years with James Stewart riding.
In the following years the KX250F and KX450F have won 14 major AMA Motocross and Supercross titles, a feat no other manufacturer can claim.</p>
