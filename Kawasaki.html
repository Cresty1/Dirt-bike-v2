    <h3>Kawasaki</h3>
<a href="index.html">Home page</a>
<p>Kawasaki is one of the ‘Big Four’ powerhouse Japanese motorcycle manufacturers. Motorcycles are just a small part of this 140-year-old company’s ventures. In this look back at 6 decades of Kawasaki Dirt Bike history, I have included many of the memorable motocross and dual sport bikes that had a significant impact at the time.</p>

<p>It is by no means a complete list, there are far too many fantastic models to include in one post.
They were the first of the ‘Big Four’ Japanese brands to build a purpose-built off-road racing machine and played a pivotal role in bringing the sport of motocross to a new audience.</p>

<p>Never afraid to push the boundaries of technology, regardless of the success of the innovation, Kawasaki has continued to remain at the forefront of competition.
If there is a bike that you feel should be included here, please feel free to add your thoughts in the comments section at the bottom of this post.</p>

<p>The Early Years
Like all of the other ‘Big Four’ Japanese motorcycle manufacturers, Kawasaki had its beginnings in areas other than motorcycles.
Kawasaki’s origins date back to 1878 when Shōzō Kawasaki established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard in Tokyo.</p>

    <p>Kawasaki Heavy Industries was formed in 1896, whose principal areas of activity were shipbuilding, railroad rolling stock and electrical generating plants.
In 1918 the Aircraft Department was established and Kawasaki succeeded in building Japan’s first metal aircraft.</p>

<p>In 1949 they turned their attention to the motorcycle industry and began making motorcycle engines. The engine was an air-cooled 148cc OHV four-stroke single-cylinder with 3.9 hp at 4,000 rpm.
In 1954 Kawasaki produced its first complete motorcycle which was produced under the name of Meihatsu, a subsidiary of Kawasaki Aircraft.</p>

<p>The bike had Kawasaki’s own KB-5 engine and an improved model was introduced in 1956. It was called the Meihatsu 125 Delux, but it wasn’t until 1956 that the Kawasaki logo was stamped on the engine side covers.</p>

<p>Kawasaki Aircraft initially manufactured motorcycles under the Meguro name, having bought the ailing motorcycle manufacturer with whom they had been in partnership. This eventually became Kawasaki Motor Sales.</p>

    <p>Kawasaki motorcycles from 1961 through to 1967 used an emblem that can be described as a flag within a wing.
In 1961 the first complete Kawasaki motorcycle, the B8 was produced. It was a 125cc two-stroke single-cylinder street machine.
In 1963 Kawasaki and Meguro merged to form Kawasaki Motorcycle Co. Ltd.</p>

<p>The 1963 Kawasaki B8-M, (the ‘Red-Tank Furore’) a motocross version of the B8 street machine was the first production motocross machine from Japan.
The B8-M was the start of the Kawasaki dirt bike legacy which evolved into the long-running KX motocross series.

<p>It featured a 123cc rotary-valve two-stroke single-cylinder engine with a four-speed manual clutch transmission. In transforming the bike into a motocrosser, the engineers removed the lights, raised the expansion chamber, upgraded the forks, changed the seat and handlebars, and added knobby tires.</p>

<p>The engine boasted 12 horsepower and the bike was so successful it took a clean sweep of the top six places in the All-Japanese Motocross Championships in 1963.</p>

<p>In 1968 the Kawasaki F21M was released. Unlike the B8M it was not based on a street bike but was designed from the ground up for scrambles racing, a tamer off-road version of motocross.

It was a 238cc rotary-valve single-cylinder two-stroke with a four-speed transmission that boasted 28 horsepower, impressive by 1968 standards.

In 1969 the F21M gained a new name and a new color. The red tank was gone and the ‘Green Streak’ was the first Kawasaki to be produced in the now-famous Kawasaki lime green.</p>

<p>During the late sixties, motocross in America was gaining in popularity. Kawasaki began its US operations in 1966 and by 1968 had dealerships nationwide.

Kawasaki’s high-performance street machines were popular among the road bike crowd, but the off-road sector was still lagging behind.</p>

<p>The 1974 Kawasaki KX250 marks the very first production year of the KX series. It was Kawasaki’s most serious off-road commitment to date and their first motorcycles designed specifically for motocross racing.

The bike featured a chrome-moly steel frame when most of the other Japanese brands of the day were still using mild steel. The 250cc piston-port two-stroke engine had a five-speed gearbox and wet clutch.

The suspension featured 5.8 inches of travel up front, and 3.5 inches at the rear, fairly standard for bikes of the day.

Even though the KX had a hard time keeping up with the Honda Elsinore CRs and the Yamaha YZ of that year, it was a significant shift for Kawasaki towards more competitive racing machines.

The KX line is one of the most successful in motocross today, and it started here with the 1974 KX250.</p>

<p>With Honda, Yamaha, and Suzuki taking turns to dominate the 250cc motocross scene, Kawasaki did not even produce a motocross machine in 1977. Most Kawasaki dealerships were more interested in selling the very popular Z-1000 street machines.

In 1978 all that changed with the release of Kawasaki’s first official ‘works-replica’ KX250 A-4. The bike was a lightweight 206 pounds and produced a staggering 40 horsepower. It was the first Long-travel suspension KX, with power and handling targeted at expert racers only.

The A-4 was available in limited numbers with only about 1500 produced. It was more about demonstrating Kawasaki’s commitment to racing than big sales and the A-4 proved that. It put Kawasaki back in the game with the other Big-Four Japanese manufacturers.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Kawasaki KX250F made its debut The chassis and bodywork featured Kawasaki’s trademark perimeter frame and KX looks. The motor was a fairly conventional DOHC four-valve fed by a 37mm Keihin FCR carburetor. The KX250F used a road-race style ‘slipper piston’ to produce a high-rpm ceiling.</p>
<p>In 2006 Kawasaki released its open class four-stroke motocrosser. They were the last of the Japanese Big Four to do so, and unlike the 250F, the new 450F was not associated with Suzuki at all, after the two manufacturers ended their alliance in May of that year.

The 450F was set for a 2005 release and was to feature a unique D-style alloy frame, but prototypes being raced in Japan were developing serious frame fractures, which led to the new frame design being scrapped completely.

After a major redesign, Kawasaki went with a more traditional alloy perimeter frame which was a proven sturdy design.

The 2006 KX450F was an instant hit with the motocross buying public. It was a very competitive first effort by Kawasaki, with the only complaint being the four-speed transmission.

The 2007 version received its fifth gear and Kawasaki claimed its first Supercross title in six years with James Stewart riding.

In the following years the KX250F and KX450F have won 14 major AMA Motocross and Supercross titles, a feat no other manufacturer can claim.</p>
