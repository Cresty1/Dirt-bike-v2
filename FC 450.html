    <h3>FC 450</h3>
<a href="index.html">Home page</a> <a href="Husqvarna.html">Husqvarna page</a>
<p>The pinnacle of Husqvarna motocross, the FC 450 uses advanced engineering techniques to not only draw massive power figures from the 450cc engine, but also position the engine shaft arrangements at the ideal center of gravity to vastly benefit handling and maneuverability. The addition of launch control means perfect acceleration off the line, while class-leading ergonomics and traction control keep the rider in full control.The SOHC cylinder head is incredibly compact and lightweight using a short profile with the camshaft located as close to the center of gravity as possible, significantly improving handling.</p>
