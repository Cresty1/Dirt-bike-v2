    <h3>RMZ250</h3>
<a href="index.html">Home page</a> <a href="Suzuki.html">Suzuki</a>
<p>the RM-Z250, an all-new model Suzki came up with in order to meet the requirements of riders who favor a strong motocross competitor with looks similar to those of the RM250. The extra Z in the badge introduces a bulletproof chassis, strong Kayaba suspensions plus a host of competition-grade upgrades and tricks aimed at turning you from a mere competitor into podium pretender.

This is one of the bikes developed as a part of the Suzuki-Kawasaki alliance. Suzuki engineered the engine, while Kawasaki did the "leg work", so this is why the RM-Z250 is such a spectacular performer.</p>
